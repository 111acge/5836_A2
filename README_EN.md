**Warning: This is group assignment content. DO NOT share with anyone outside the group!**

## Issues to Address
1. ROC and AUC sections need correction
2. P2Q5 (commentary section) currently uses GPT-generated content, needs revision
   * All commentary sections may need review
3. Need to check for any missing questions

## Repository Usage Guide

### 1. Get the Code
There are two ways to obtain the code:
- **Option 1: Direct Download**
  - Download the ZIP file locally and extract it
- **Option 2: Clone Repository**
  - Copy the repository URL and execute in your local terminal:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
  ```
  - Example:
  ```bash

### 2. Enter Project Directory
Choose either method:
- Using command line:
  ```bash

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Project
